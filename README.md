# StockSoftware
This is my final project for Programming Concept/Methods II, a stock market ticker information software that displays stock information, stock data, and stock charts of the given stock symbol entered. This software gets real-time stock market data from the Yahoo Finance API using json and displays it on a graphical user interface, using MVC (Model / View/ Controller), where users can search for their stock ticker and get a good amount of data on the stock and even daily news. I have also created a function to check the stock's dividend payout ratio by doing some calculations with the data pulled from the API.
